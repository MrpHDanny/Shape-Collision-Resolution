# Shapes-Collisions-Resolution

This is an excerpt implementation for shape collision resolution from a larger project.
This is meant to demonstrate collision detection algorithms for Circle and AABB shapes (circle and rectangle classes)
as well as collision resolution with projection and impulses (gamephysics class)
